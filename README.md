# Social Media Advertisement Analytics using Power-bi
# Project Overview
This project analyzes a large dataset of social media advertisement campaigns using Power BI. The dataset covers several key performance indicators (KPIs) such as acquisition costs, conversion rates, ROI, and engagement scores. The data is analyzed to understand the effectiveness of different social media platforms, target audiences, customer segments, and campaign goals, helping to inform future marketing strategies.
# Dataset Summary
+ Total Campaign IDs: 300,000
+ Total Acquisition Cost: $2.33 billion
+	Total ROI: $953,310
+	Conversion Rate: 24,000 campaigns
+	Clicks: 5 billion
The data spans from 1st January 2022 to 31st December 2022.
# Key Metrics Analyzed
+	Clicks: The total number of clicks generated by different campaigns across platforms.
+	Conversion Rate: The percentage of clicks that led to successful conversions (e.g., sales, signups).

+	Engagement Score: A composite score representing user interaction levels with the campaigns.
+	Acquisition Cost: The total cost to acquire customers through the campaigns.
# Analysis Highlights
The project covers a wide range of analysis using Power BI visualizations:
## Target Audience Insights
+ Conversion Rate by Age Group: Analysis of conversion rates across different age ranges, including 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, and 45-60.
+	Gender Breakdown: Insights into how campaigns perform among different gender groups (Men, Women, and Mixed).
## Platform Comparison
+	Conversion Rates by Social Media Channel: Evaluates performance across platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Pinterest.
+	Engagement Score by Channel: Compares user engagement levels on different social media platforms.
## Customer Segments
+	Engagement Score by Customer Segment: Focuses on different customer segments such as Health, Fashion, Food, Technology, and Home.
## Campaign Goals
+	ROI by Campaign Goal: Assesses ROI for different objectives like Product Launch, Brand Awareness, Sales Increase, and Market Expansion.

## Campaign Duration and Performance
+	ROI by Campaign Duration: Analyzes how the length of campaigns (15, 30, 45, 60 days) impacts performance.
+	Conversion Rate by Duration: Determines whether longer or shorter campaigns yield better conversion rates.
# Visualizations
The analysis is primarily visualized through interactive Power BI dashboards, offering users the ability to filter and explore data from different perspectives. Some of the key visualizations include:
+	Bar charts comparing conversion rates and engagement scores across different customer segments and platforms.
+	Line charts showing trends in ROI and acquisition costs over the year.
+	Pie charts illustrating the distribution of campaigns by age group, gender, and location.
+	Maps showing conversion and engagement by geographical location.
